# Palindrome_1
A Program to check if a number is Palindome using Reverse/Add algorithm. 
To reverse user input this program is using Stack as its data structure. Using Stack makes this program to be open to future extentsion and close to more modicfication, 
since no matter the input type, the stack can always reverse the input.
The program also returns the number of calculations done to achieve the Palindrome number. 
In addition, it determines if a number is Lychrel (does not have a Palindrome).
